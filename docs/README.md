## How to build the docs
From the root directory of the repository, do the following to steps

1. Install docs' dependencies

    ```
    pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
    ```
    On Linux, you may need to use `pip3` instead.

2. Build the docs

    ```
    mkdocs build
    ```

    or use the following command to see changes rendered in realtime.
    ```
    mkdocs serve
    ```
