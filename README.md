A Github Action for linting C/C++ code integrating clang-tidy and clang-format
to collect feedback provided in the form of
[`file-annotations`][file-annotations], [`thread-comments`][thread-comments],
workflow [`step-summary`][step-summary], and Pull Request reviews (with
[`tidy-review`][tidy-review] or [`format-review`][format-review]).

> [!WARNING]
> We only support Linux runners using a Debian based Linux OS (like Ubuntu and many others).
>
> MacOS and Windows runners are supported as well.

## What's New

v2

* Change action from using docker to composite steps
  * improve workflow runs times from 1m 24s (using v1) to 6-20s (for simple workflow runs).
  * better support for the database input option (which was broken with the docker environment in v1).
  * better support cross-compilation
  * better support 3rd party libraries
* Includes many issues and enhancements. See [#87](https://github.com/cpp-linter/cpp-linter-action/issues/87) for details.

Refer [here](https://github.com/cpp-linter/cpp-linter-action/tree/v1) for previous versions.

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> Python 3.10 needs to be installed in the docker image if your workflow is
> [running jobs in a container](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/running-jobs-in-a-container)
> (see discussion in [#185](https://github.com/cpp-linter/cpp-linter-action/issues/185)).
> Our intention is to synchronize with the default python version included with Ubuntu latest LTS releases.

Create a new GitHub Actions workflow in your project, e.g. at [.github/workflows/cpp-linter.yml](https://github.com/cpp-linter/cpp-linter-action/blob/main/.github/workflows/cpp-linter.yml)

The content of the file should be in the following format.

```yaml
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: cpp-linter/cpp-linter-action@v2
        id: linter
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          style: 'file'  # Use .clang-format config file
          tidy-checks: '' # Use .clang-tidy config file
          # only 'update' a single comment in a pull request's thread.
          thread-comments: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' && 'update' }}
      - name: Fail fast?!
        if: steps.linter.outputs.checks-failed > 0
        run: exit 1
```

For all explanations of our available input parameters and output variables, see our
[Inputs and Outputs document][io-doc].
