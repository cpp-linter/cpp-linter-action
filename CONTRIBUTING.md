# Contributing

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! We welcome feedback, bug reports, and pull requests!

## New contributor guide

Ours develop branch is `main` not `master` (`master` used to be the develop branch for v1.x).

The reason we didn't delete the `master` branch is that there are still users whose workflows point to the `master` branch.

For pull requests, please stick to the following guidelines

* Add tests for any new features and bug fixes.
* Put a reasonable amount of comments into the code.
* Fork cpp-linter-action on your GitHub user account, do your changes there and then create a PR against `main` branch of cpp-linter-action repository.
* Separate unrelated changes into multiple pull requests.

If you wish to contribute to the python source package used by this action, then that has moved to it's own repository named [cpp-linter](https://github.com/cpp-linter/cpp-linter) as of v2 of this action.

Please note that by contributing any code or documentation to this repository (by raising pull requests, or otherwise) you explicitly agree to the [License Agreement](https://github.com/cpp-linter/cpp-linter-action/blob/main/LICENSE).
